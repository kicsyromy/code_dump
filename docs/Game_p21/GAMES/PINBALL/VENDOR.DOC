                                EPIC PINBALL
              Version 2.0 from Epic MegaGames (Member ASP)
=============================================================================

DESCRIPTION:

   Epic Pinball brings true arcade-style Pinball to life on your PC!  The
   256-color scrolling VGA graphics, digital music and sound, and ultra-
   realistic style will take your breath away!  This true commercial-quality
   product was created by the authors of Silverball, the new record-setting
   retail pinball game.
  
   The shareware version of Epic Pinball showcases the new SUPER ANDROID
   pinball table.  True to the 1990's pinball style,  you must make an
   increasingly-challenging series of shots to bring the Android to life!
   The dazzling graphics, real pinball sounds, and authentic look and
   feel will keep you hooked on Epic Pinball - a great game for the whole
   family.

UPDATE (April 25, 1994):

   This is the second major release of Epic Pinball.  Since the first release
   in October,  Epic Pinball has gone on to win top reviews from game
   magazines worldwide, and has become the #2 game on the Shareware Top Ten!

   This new version of Pinball adds several major features to the
   original:  An improved SUPER ANDROID table with lots of little
   improvements,  revolutionary Surround Sound support for stereo sound
   cards,  and improved music and sound.

   We'd like to take this opportunity to give a big "THANKS!" to all of the
   numerous shareware vendors who have contributed to Pinball's success.
   Because of your support,  Epic has grown to new heights, and we're
   dedicated to making 1994 and 1995 monumental years for shareware games.
