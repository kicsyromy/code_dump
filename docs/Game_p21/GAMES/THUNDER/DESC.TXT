You are Thor, the God of Thunder! Armed with your enchanted hammer and considerable wits, you must think and fight your way past dozens of puzzles and hundreds of enemies to reach the final showdown with the Midgard Serpent.
Along the way you will meet many ignorant villagers who try to help, but usually just make you laugh with their humorous responses.
Complete with Sound Blaster digitized sound and a full Adlib soundtrack.
