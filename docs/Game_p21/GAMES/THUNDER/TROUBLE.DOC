PROBLEM:
     Not Enough Memory
SOLUTION:
     Try removing TSR's (such as mouse drivers) from your config.sys and
     autoexec.bat files.
     If you have DOS version 5 or above, include the line:

          dos=high

     in your config.sys file after "himem.sys" or another memory manager has
     been loaded.


PROBLEM:
     Sound isn't working correctly, or the game locks up
SOLUTION:
     Use the command-line sound card override.
     Load God of Thunder with one of the command-line options:

          GOT /NOSB      -    If you DO NOT have a Soundblaster card.
          GOT /NOAL      -    If you DO NOT have an Adlib Card.
          GOT /NOJOY     -    If you DO NOT have a joystick.

SOUND BLASTER HELP
------------------
If your Sound Blaster or compatible card is not working in God of Thunder,
try setting the environmental variable BLASTER by typing:

     SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx

     Axxx represents the address of the SoundBlaster/SB Pro.  For the SB,
          it's either A210,A220,A230,A240,A250 or A260.  For the SB Pro, 
          it's either A220 or A240.  The default is A220.
     
       Ix represents the IRQ number used by the SB/SB Pro.  For the SB, it's
          either I2, I5, or I7.  The default is I7.

       Dx represents the DMA channel used by the SB/SB Pro.  Acceptable values
          are D0, D1, or D3.  The default is D1.

If the game continually locks up and you have a Sound Blaster, as a last
resort try disabling the digitized Sound Blaster samples by using the Adlib
command-line override (GOT /NOSB).

God of Thunder should have come without the configuration file "CONFIG.GOT".  
If you can't solve the problems you are having, try erasing this file.  
God of Thunder will create a new config file based on your system.
