a combination of colorful 3-D animated graphics and text.  Great graphics are
accompanied by music and a good sense of humor along the way.

You control HUGO'S destiny as he tries to rescue his sweetheart who is
imprisoned somewhere inside the haunted house, and you must solve the various
puzzles and challenges encountered during his quest.  You will be glued to the
screen for hours as you track you way through the haunted rooms.

Other features include save and restore, sound options, inventory keeping,
on-line help and the all important boss key.

of information and trivia not found anywhere else.

HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS requires an IBM compatible computer with EGA graphics,
at least 360Kb of ram and 850Kb of disk space.  A hard disk is not essential
but highly recommended.

±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  4.1  START-UP PROCEDURE  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±


Start HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS by typing HHH.

The registered version allows you to add one or more switches as follows:
		HHH -s          Disables the sound
		HHH -r          Runs the program in RECORD mode
		HHH -p          Runs the program in PLAYBACK mode

To finish the game early, type either QUIT or EXIT at the prompt.





±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  4.2  HOW TO PLAY  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±


To move HUGO, use either your arrow keys or the numeric keypad (remember to
turn the Num-Lock off).  If using the keypad, diagonal movement is possible.

To stop HUGO simply type the same cursor key (or numeric keypad key) twice.
Remember there is no need to hold down the button for HUGO to keep moving.

Use simple English to instruct HUGO to perform an action.  For example "look
around" or "look at door" to look at things.  To pick something up try "pick
up the gold" or "get gold" or "take gold" etc.  Many synonyms are allowed but
if HUGO doesn't seem to understand, try re-phrasing your command.

Certain actions carry a bonus score when carried out, as does picking up
useful objects.  When you have successfully completed the game, your score
should match the maximum score shown on the status line at the top of the
screen.

If you have trouble solving some of the puzzles in this game, there are a
couple of hints in section 4.5 of this manual.  There is also a hint booklet
available when you register with the author.  This hint booklet contains a
range of hints, from cryptic to obvious, for each room.  To register please
refer to the README.DOC file for ordering information.

Registered users also receive a self-running version of the game (see section
on record and playback) which runs through the game unattended and achieves
the maximum score possible.  It is also useful for demonstration purposes
as it is simple to run it endlessly from a loop within a batch file.  The
registered version also allows you to record your own games and play them
back later.





±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  4.3  FUNCTION KEYS  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±


F1  ..........  Press once for a reminder of the other function keys.
		Press twice for help.


F2  ..........  TURNS SOUND ON OR OFF.  Note that sound does not play
		continuously.  The status of this button is shown in the
		status line at the top of the screen.


F3  ..........  REPEATS LAST COMMAND.  This key is useful to allow you to
		repeat a command or edit the last command.


F4  ..........  SAVES A GAME. If you have to leave the game early but wish to
		save your current position, use this feature by pressing F4.

		You will see a text box appear with eight rows of dotted lines
		and an arrow pointing to the first.  These are empty "slots"
		which allow you to save up to eight versions of the game.
		Press return and the arrow will flash by the first slot,
		prompting you to enter a short description of your current
		game, e.g. "In the Kitchen", press return to save the game and
		then either continue or leave the game by typing QUIT or EXIT.

		When you return to run the game again, use the F5 button to
		restore it.  You may re-use any slot and either retain the
		same description or type another.


F5  ..........  RESTORE A PREVIOUSLY SAVED GAME.  Select a "slot" as described
		in function F4.  Note you may not select an empty slot!  Hit
		return to restore the game.


F6  ..........  INVENTORY.  Pressing F6 puts up a text box to show you what
		objects you are currently carrying.


F9  ..........  BOSS BUTTON.  So-named because it instantly removes all traces
		of the game from the screen and places you in a normal DOS
		environment from which you can perform your regular work-like
		commands.  Note, however, that the game is still lurking unseen
		in the background and the amount of memory available to you is
		reduced by about 280Kb.  Resume your game at the next opportune
		moment by typing EXIT.  [Note:  You must have sufficient
		memory (at least 512K) before running HUGO for the boss button
		to work, and command.com must either reside in one of your
		PATH directories or have a suitable COMSPEC or SHELL command.
		See your MSDOS manual for an explanation of these terms.]





±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  4.4  RECORD AND PLAYBACK  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±


The registered version of the game includes record and playback modes.  This
effectively allows you to construct a self-running version of the game and a
sample playback file is included which runs right through the game from start
to finish, achieving the maximum score possible.

To run this playback file, make sure the supplied PLAYBACK.DAT file is in the
same directory as your registered version of the game and type: HHH -p

This self-running game might be suitable for, say, a child who is too young
to play the game but can watch the game like a story.  To disable the sound
during the playback, type: HHH -p -s

To record your own game, start the program by typing: HHH -r   Note that this
will create a file PLAYBACK.DAT which will overwrite any previous file of
that name, including the one supplied.  If you wish to save a previous
PLAYBACK.DAT, copy it to another directory or rename it.

Some points to watch when recording are:

þ  When a text box appears on the screen, it will stay up for a period of time
   which depends on how much text there is to read.  When the time is up, the
   program beeps to let you know you can continue.  This is because during
   playback, there should be no manual intervention.

þ  Don't try to use the Save and Restore features, this would require manual
   intervention during playback.

þ  The same goes for the BOSS button.

þ  You may use the F1, F2, F3, F6 buttons during recording.





±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  4.5  HELP HINTS  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±


There are one or two places in the game where a large number of players have
got well and truly stuck.  For this reason here are some clues for the most
popular areas of befuddlement.  Remember only to read further if you need
help, otherwise it could spoil your enjoyment ...

CAN'T GET IN THE FRONT DOOR ...... Although this is an easy problem for
experienced adventurers, to a novice it will be extremely baffling.  The key
to the front door is hidden inside the pumpkin.

First move close to the pumpkin and say "get pumpkin" then say "drop pumpkin"
or "break open pumpkin" to reveal the key.  Now pick up the key ("pick up key")
and walk over to the front door and say "unlock door" and finally "open door".
You can now move HUGO through the door with the cursor key and you are in the
hallway of HUGO'S house and ready to start the game.

WHO IS ASLAN, ANYWAY? ...... While some people have thoroughly enjoyed
tormenting their local library assistant while researching the answers to the
old man's riddles and trivia questions, others have stayed up all night tearing
their hair out.  To these, my sincere condolences and the answers are:

	1.  Bilbo
	2.  Narnia
	3.  Bram Stoker
	4.  Man
	5.  C
	6.  Bullet
	7.  The last one is up to you!
