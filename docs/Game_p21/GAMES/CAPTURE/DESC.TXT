Dash through verdant woodlands, jump over gushing streams, climb rail fences, and race through farm fields as you search for the opposing team's flag in a desperate race to capture their flag before they capture yours. Analyze your defensive team's skills, develop their tactics, then deploy them in natural cover to intercept and capture the opposition raiders.
Choose between running, walking, crawling, or just a standing search as lookout.  Enjoy the suspense and sounds (supports Adlib and Sound Blaster) of battle.  All of this action takes place on a huge, beautifully detailed playing field in gorgeous HIGH resolution VGA (640 by 480 in 16 colors), with synchronized sound and great animation.
