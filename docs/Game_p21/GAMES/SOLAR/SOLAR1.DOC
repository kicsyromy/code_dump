ABOUT THE GAME:

Solar Winds combines both fast-action arcade excitement with a detailed
story that develops as you progress through the game!  With 256-color
VGA graphics and a beautifully-orchestrated musical sound track,  this
1993 Epic MegaGames release will keep you entertained for many hours
of play.

In Solar Winds,  you play the role of Jake Stone,  bounty hunter.  As you
explore the galaxy on various missions,  you'll fend off hostile attackers
to achieve your goals.  Meanwhile,  a dark and mysterious plot develops
as you progress.  The nature of the plot won't be fully revealed until you
solve Solar Winds.

Solar Winds is situated in space and features smooth-scrolling 256-color
graphics as you navigate around the galaxy.  In addition to using your arcade
skills, Solar Winds requires quite a bit of strategy to master.

   HINT

This game is equipped with a "Save" feature -- so remember to save your game
often.  Later on,  if your bratty little brother unplugs the computer
while you are playing,  you won't need to start over!


   HOW TO START

To go,  just type SOLAR1 from the DOS prompt -- and you're ready to begin.


   NOTE TO SOUND BLASTER OWNERS:

Solar Winds sports a musical sound track and digitized sound effects.  If you
experience trouble (lockups or aborts), try booting from a blank
floppy disk with no TSR's loaded.  If this doesn't solve the problem, your
best bet is to TURN OFF THE DIGITAL SOUND EFFECTS.

Sorry, Solar Winds doesn't support the Adlib card.  Only the genuine Sound
Blaster card.


   TROUBLE-SHOOTING

First of all,  we recommend NOT running Solar Winds through Microsoft Windows.
While,  if you are lucky,  Solar Winds may function properly under Windows,
this is not recommended.  Please run Solar Winds from DOS.

If you're using a disk compression utility like Stacker or SuperStor,  you
might run into problems running Solar Winds.  If this happens,  please
install Solar Winds on a non-compressed part of your hard disk.

If Solar Winds locks up when you first run the game, type:
   SOLAR1 /NOSB  (if you don't have a Sound Blaster)

If Solar Winds is giving you intermittent problems, boot from a blank floppy
disk with no TSR's in memory.  You might possibly run into problems with:
   - Memory managers like QEMM
   - Disk Caches
   - Any other kind of TSR program

Make sure your FILES= and BUFFERS= lines in CONFIG.SYS are set to at least 25.
