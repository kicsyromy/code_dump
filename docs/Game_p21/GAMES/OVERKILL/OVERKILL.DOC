   OVERKILL

OverKill is a fast-action arcade game.  On your journey through this
shareware version,  you'll visit the first two planets in the six-planet
OverKill saga!

   THE STORY

You arrive at your home planet after a long space flight, only to find it
has been destroyed by a demonic warlike alien race that kills for sheer
pleasure. You are now the last of your race and out for revenge.

Your single minded quest is to destroy the alien leader's heavily armoured
Battle Star at the end of planet 6. But before you reach the Battle Star you
will have to battle your way through massive levels packed with danger,
freeing six other planets from the tyranny of these creatures.

Some of the dangers you will face include meteor storms, space forts,
hideous creatures and strange space ships of incredible power, piloted by
aliens who will do anything to stop you.

Although you have limited fuel and weapons supplies, both can be collected
on your long and perilous journey by picking up pods from the remains of
alien crafts and creatures you have killed before reaching your ultimate
goal.

If you are lucky you will have collected enough pods to have built the
ultimate battle cruiser, a craft of immense fire power and capable of mass
destruction, yet even this craft may not be enough when you reach the final
battle ground.

   COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

The game can be started with several command line
parameters depending on your system:

   /R will start the game for a Roland Soundboard
   /A will start the game for an Adlib Soundboard
   /E will start the game for an EGA monitor
   /C will start the game for a CGA monitor
   /T will start the game for a Tandy monitor


   HINTS

1.  Read the instructions!  If you don't,  you will surely miss the
    section on how to activate new weapons you find,  and you won't
    get very far.

2.  If it moves shoot it, if it doesn't move shoot it anyway!  After all,
    this is OverKill.
