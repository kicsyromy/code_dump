             A new release from Epic MegaGames:
                   BRIX by MICHAEL RIEDEL

Requirements:
     ˛  256-color VGA graphics
     ˛  640K memory and DOS 3.0 or later, and a hard disk

Also supports:
     ˛  Sound Blaster & compatible music cards
     ˛  Mouse

Brix is an arcade and puzzle experience!  Don't let the ultra smooth 256-
color VGA graphics and animation fool you into thinking Brix is just an
arcade game,  because your brain will be taunted,  teased,  and twisted
as must as your reflexes.

Your task in Brix seems simple:  Eliminate all of the colored bricks by
uniting them.  But the 112 levels in Brix I are also habitated by lasers,
elevators,  boiling acid,  anti-gravity,  teleporters,  and more!  There are
enough hand-crafted puzzles in this Epic action-puzzler duo to keep you busy
for eons.

Check out Brix,  another fine release from the publishers of Jill of the
Jungle,  ZZT,  and Kiloblaster.

Written by Michael Riedel, published by Epic MegaGames.
Registration is $30 + $4 p&h,  and includes Brix I and Brix II Deluxe, and
a disk of bonus games.  See ORDER.DOC for ordering info!
