               Brix I:  A New Shareware Release
               --------------------------------

Created by:  Michael Riedel
Published by Epic MegaGames

Brix is an arcade and puzzle experience!  Don't let the ultra smooth 256-
color VGA graphics and animation fool you into thinking Brix is just an
arcade game,  because your brain will be taunted,  teased,  and twisted
as must as your reflexes.

Your task in Brix seems simple:  Eliminate all of the colored bricks by
uniting them.  But the 112 levels in Brix 1 are also habitated by lasers,
elevators,  boiling acid,  anti-gravity,  teleporters,  and more!  There are
enough hand-crafted puzzles in this Epic action-puzzler duo to keep you busy
for eons.

Check out Brix,  another fine release from the publishers of Jill of the
Jungle,  ZZT,  and Kiloblaster!


Registration
============

Registration is $30 + $4 p&h,  and earns you Brix I and Brix II Deluxe (with
112 awesome new levels,  level editor,  and a level solver),  and a disk of
Epic's latest bonus games.  Print ORDER.DOC for ordering instructions.


Starting
========

To start Brix,  type:

   BRIX1

Brix also speaks German!  To start the German version of Brix,  type:

   BRIX1 /d


Troubleshooting
===============

If Brix gives you a "Not Enough Memory" message,  you need to free up more
system memory,  then start over again.  Suggestions:

* Try renaming your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files,  then rebooting.
  This will prevent memory-hogging SR's from being loaded.

* Create a boot disk and reboot.  To do this:
  1.  Put a blank disk in the A: drive.
  2.  Type:  FORMAT A: /S
  3.  Once the disk is formatted,  keep the disk drive door closed and
      reboot your computer.

If Brix still refuses to load properly,  the problem is most likely due to
Brix scanning your system for a Sound Blaster card.  To solve this,  type:

   BRIX1 /nosb      (This turns off the Sound Blaster card)


Playing Brix
============

Your main goal is to remove all of the objects (brix) from the screen.  To
remove them,  you need to put them together -- which causes them to explode.
This is easy enough with two objects,  but can be very tricky with three
or more.  (Try to figure it out!)

To pick up an object,  move the red cursor above it and press [space].  The
cursor turns white while you are carrying an object.


Secret Codes
============

When you leave the game (because you missed or finished a level),  you will be
tols a secret code.  Remeber this!  You can use it later to start back at the
level without going through all of the previous levels.  Use the "Secret Code"
option in the main menu.


Difficulty levels
=================

Brix has four difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard.  While you're
first learning to play,  we recommend the easy level.  It gives you more
time to complete each puzzle.


While playing!
==============

Press [Escape] to bring up a menu of options:
   Abort game:  Lets you leave the actual game.  Use this option once you've
                thoroughly given up and need to take a break!
   Continue game:  Keep on playing!
   Retry level:  Lets you start over from scratch on the current level, in
                case you've gotten into an unsolvable mess.  Beware,  the
                time is not set back!
   Solve:  Brix will solve the level for you.  (Brix 2 Deluxe only!)  This will
                cost you 20000 points in the second level,  40000 points in the
                third level,  and so on.
