                               -= Zone 66 =-

THE STORY:

   You have landed in a clearing.  Frantically,  you rush through the woods
toward the lights of the city far off in the distance.  A vision of your
family dances in your head -- your wife and the newborn daughter you have not
yet seen.  You must save them.  As you finally scramble to a bluff
panoramically overlooking the city,  you see the lights in the sky and you
realize it is too late.  The flash nearly blinds you,  and when vision
returns,  you feel nothing but anger as the massive mushroom cloud looms
over the city.  You are too late to save your home,  but other cities remain,
and they are vulnerable.  It is up to you alone to unravel the plot and hold
back the enemy attackers.
