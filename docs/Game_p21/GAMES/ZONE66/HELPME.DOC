ZONE 66 Version 1.5                 *         Troubleshooting  &  Hints
=============================================================================

			   How to start ZONE 66
			   ====================

ZONE 66 requires:
  * A 386, 486 or faster IBM-compatible computer
  * Hard disk
  * At least 2 Megabytes of RAM

To get the maximum possible performance out of your system,  ZONE 66 uses an
ultra fast mode on your 386 or 486 PC (called "flat protected mode").  The
advantage is a super-fast game packed with graphics.

Previous versions of ZONE 66 required you to boot your machine with no memory-
managers installed, usually from a boot diskette.  This version of ZONE 66 
will happily co-exist with most memory managers, meaning that a boot diskette 
is no longer needed.  However, there are two important things to remember:

      When running under a memory manager, all sound effects will be 
      played through your computer's speaker.  The musical soundtrack 
      will be played via the soundcard (if present).

      To enable the sound effects to be played by the soundcard, the 
      computer must be booted without a memory manager, as described 
      below.

To start ZONE 66:

1. Switch to the drive where the game is installed (C:)
2. Switch to the subdirectory where the game is installed (CD\ZONE66)
3. Type ZONE66.

Now here is a complete walk-through of how to create a boot disk for 
playing ZONE 66:

TO CREATE THE BOOT DISK
=======================

A.  Put a blank disk in your A: drive.
B.  From the DOS prompt,  type the following command:

       FORMAT A: /S

C.  Press ENTER.
D.  Wait while your computer formats the disk and turns it into a boot disk.
E.  Label the disk "Zone 66 Boot Disk" and keep it handy.  You'll need this
    disk whenever you want to start ZONE 66.

TO START YOUR COMPUTER FROM THE BOOT DISK
=========================================

A.  Put the boot disk in your A: drive.
B.  Restart your computer,  either by pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE,  by
    hitting your reset button,  or by turning it on.
C.  Wait while your computer boots from the boot disk.
D.  After a little while, your computer will stop and give you the A> prompt.

TO START ZONE 66 AFTER DOING ALL OF THE ABOVE
=============================================

A.  Change onto your hard drive by typing:

	 C:          <Now press ENTER>

    Note to "Stacker" owners:  If your C: drive is compressed, then you
    must install ZONE 66 on a different,  non-compressed drive.
    So type the letter of that drive instead of "C".

B.  Switch into your ZONE 66 directory by typing:

	 CD \ZONE66

    Note:  If you have installed the game in a different directory,
    switch into that directory instead.

C.  Start the game by typing:

    ZONE66

    If you run into any problems,  skip ahead to the TROUBLESHOOTING section.


NOTE TO OWNERS OF "STACKER" AND OTHER DISK-COMPRESSION PROGRAMS
===============================================================

ZONE 66 will not work on a drive that is compressed with Stacker or another
disk-compression program.  This is due to an unresolvable memory management
conflict between the programs.

If you're using Stacker or something similar,  you can get ZONE 66 to work
on your computer by installing it on a non-compressed partition of your hard
disk,  and by following the "boot disk" procedures listed above.  Stacker
usually reserves the drive D: for your uncompressed partition.

Note:  If your D: drive is set up so that it doesn't have enough free space
       for ZONE 66 to fit,  consult your Stacker documentation for
       instructions on increasing the size of the D: drive.  (No other
       solution exists to the Stacker conflict)

ZONE 66 *will* work on machines with Double Space (DOS V6.0 disk compression 
program) in place.  In some circumstances, however, Double Space does not 
leave enough system resources free for the game to run properly.  In that 
case, we recommend installing the game on an uncompressed partition (usually 
drive H:).  Please refer to your DOS V6.0 manual for information about 
Double Space and instructions on how to increase the uncompressed partition 
size.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Here are a list of possible problems you may run into,  as well as some
suggested solutions.

Problem:  When I type "ZONE66" to start,  the computer locks up.

Solutions:

   1.  ZONE 66 may have a problem detecting whether your PC has a sound card
       installed.  Instead of typing just "ZONE66",  please type one of the
       following commands instead:

       ZONE66 /n   (If you do NOT have a sound card installed in your PC)
       ZONE66 /s   (If you have a true Sound Blaster card)
       ZONE66 /u   (If you have a Gravis Ultrasound card)
       ZONE66 /a   (If you have an Adlib card)

   2.  If this fails to solve the problem,  make sure that you're following
       the correct "boot disk" procedure described above.  If you go through
       all of the steps,  create a boot disk,  and start ZONE 66 from a boot
       disk and it still doesn't work,  then your computer unfortunately is
       not compatible with ZONE 66.  

Problem:  When I begin playing,  my plane flies around in circles!

Solutions:

   1. If you DO NOT have a joystick, then you need to start ZONE 66 with the
      following command:

      ZONE66 /k   (For keyboard operation -- no joystick)

   2. If you DO have a joystick,  go into the "OPTIONS" menu from the main
      menu and select "CALIBRATE JOYSTICK".  This should solve the
      problem.  If it doesn't, then your joystick is incompatible with 
      ZONE 66 -- so use the following command to disable the joystick
      (and then use the keyboard):

      ZONE66 /k   (For keyboard operation -- if your joystick steers wrong)

Problem:  Zone 66 does not work properly with my Sound Blaster card,  even
	  when I use the ZONE66 /S option.

Solutions:  

   1.  ZONE 66 can only recognize your Sound Blaster card if it is set for
       IRQ 3, 5, or 7.  If your Sound Blaster is set to IRQ 2 or 10,  ZONE 66
       will not recognize it.  To remedy this,  see your Sound Blaster
       manual for instructions on changing the IRQ.  Or,  if you prefer, 
       start ZONE 66 by typing "ZONE66 /a" and you'll get the Adlib musical
       sound track, but no digital sound effects.

   2.  Note that ZONE 66 is only designed for use with true Sound Blaster
       cards,  and it may not function properly with sound cards from other
       manufacturers.

Note to Pro Audio Spectrum owners:  Zone 66 can often be made to work with the
PAS if you create a CONFIG.SYS file that loads that PAS driver (MVSOUND.SYS).
If this doesn't work,  try running Zone 66 with the following command:

			 ZONE66 /N

Problem:  Zone 66 detects my Gravis Ultrasound card,  but I don't get any
	  music.

Solution: Please check your disk to make sure the file M03GMUZ.Z66 exists.
	  If it doesn't,  then you have a copy of ZONE 66 which does not
	  contain the Gravis soundtrack.  To get the Gravis soundtrack,
	  look for the file $ZONE66G.ZIP on your local BBS,  or you can get
	  the latest version of ZONE 66 Mission 1 along with the Gravis
	  sound track direct from Epic MegaGames for $5.  (See ORDERING INFO
	  within the game)


NOTES ABOUT WINDOWS AND OS/2
