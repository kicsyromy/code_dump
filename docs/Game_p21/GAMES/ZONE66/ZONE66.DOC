ABOUT THE GAME:

   You have landed in a clearing.  Frantically,  you rush through the woods
toward the lights of the city far off in the distance.  A vision of your
family dances in your head -- your wife and the newborn daughter you have not
yet seen.  You must save them.  As you finally scramble to a bluff
panoramically overlooking the city,  you see the lights in the sky and you
realize it is too late.  The flash nearly blinds you,  and when vision
returns,  you feel nothing but anger as the massive mushroom cloud looms
over the city.  You are too late to save your home,  but other cities remain,
and they are still vulnerable.  It is up to you alone to unravel the plot
and hold back the enemy attackers.

Zone 66 is a high-tech 32-bit arcade game for 386 and faster computers.
You fly your fighter jet through a huge 360-degree scrolling playfield that's
jam-packed with 256-color enemies and terrain.  Inflict massive damage on the
enemy bunkers,  artilery,  and industrial sites,  leaving craters and
devastated earth in your wake.
