You land in a clearing and rush through the woods toward the lights of the city far off in the distance. As you scramble to a bluff overlooking the city, you see the lights in the sky and you realize it is too late. The flash nearly blinds you, and when vision returns, you feel nothing but anger as the mushroom cloud looms over the city. You are too late, but other cities remain and they are vulnerable. It is up to you alone to unravel the plot and hold back the enemy attackers.
