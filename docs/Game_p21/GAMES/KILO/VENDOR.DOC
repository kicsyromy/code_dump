=============================================================================

              KILOBLASTER version 1.0 from Epic MegaGames

 * See KILO.DOC for a description and notes.  Feel free to use this in your    
   shareware catalogs and displays!
     
 * You have permission to distribute this software, as long as you make
   it clear that this is SHAREWARE,  you charge less than $10 for the disk,
   and no files are modified or deleted.

 * By the way -- feel free to add your own auto-install program to this
   disk,  or archive it however you wish.  That's fine with us.  You can
   also split the files up to fit on 2 disks if you wish.

 * VERY IMPORTANT!  Please do not modify or remove the KILO.BAT file on this
   disk.  It is VITAL to starting up the game properly.

 * NOTE: We have -two- shareware versions of Kiloblaster:  One that fits on
   a 360K disk compressed,  and the larger version that requires two 360K
   disks or one 720K disk (with more graphics and fancy stuff!)

 * DEALERS: All of Epic's hot new products are being sold to resellers in
   quantity at a discount (we're selling -lots- of these packages!)  Call
   for information,  and we can set your company up as an Epic reseller.
   HINT: These products are *hot* sellers for retailers and mail-order
   sellers alike.

 * VENDORS: Please send us a catalog, or a request on your company letterhead
   and we'll put you on our mailing list.  Get the latest Epic releases
   directly from the source!
