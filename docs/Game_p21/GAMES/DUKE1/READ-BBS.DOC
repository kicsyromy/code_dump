The following descriptions should be used as a guideline if
you wish to put this game on your favorite BBS.  Thanks!


SHORT DESCRIPTION:
Duke Nukem is an arcade/adventure game like none ever
seen on an IBM PC.  It features huge four-way, dual-scrolling
playfields with realistic graphics, and animation that
updates 48 frames per second!  Over 1Meg of total graphics.
Duke is an amazing hero, who does flips and clings to
ceilings.  Help him save the world on his first action-
packed adventure.

Other features include:  Large animated enemies, built-in
hint mode, joystick support, self-running demo, arcade
sound effects, save/restore, and much more.


FULL DESCRIPTION:
After the tremendous response to Commander Keen, Apogee's
follow-up game had to be really spectacular.  And Duke
Nukem is just that--a superb showstopper with over one Meg
of animation and graphics, four times more than Commander
Keen had!

This is an arcade/adventure game that compares to the
Sega Genesis home systems.  (It's far superior to games
typically seen on the Nintendo home system.)

Duke Nukem also has four-way, dual scrolling playfields,
and does it better than any other IBM game.  Features:
Large animated characters, reflections, arcade sound
effects, built-in hint mode, joystick support,
cinematic sequences, self-running demo mode,
save/restore, high scores, etc.

Rarely is a game released with such a well animated main
character.  Duke Nukem does realistic somersaults and uses
his grappling hooks to hand-walk along ceilings.  Duke is a
hero everyone will like.

Duke Nukem is rendered in vivid EGA graphics, with many special
screen effects.  As usual, Apogee offers two more episodes
if players want to continue their adventures with Duke.

This is truly a game that will demonstrate the graphical
abilities of your computer if you have EGA or VGA.  Get
ready for a fun time as you rescue the world from the
latest madman, Dr. Proton.

Hardware Requirements:  IBM PC or compatible with 640k RAM,
hard drive, and optional joystick.

This game is NOT crippled in any way.
