JILL OF THE JUNGLE VERSION 1.0 from Epic MegaGames (Member ASP)

     Jill of the Jungle is the hottest shareware game release ever!  Epic
MegaGames brings you a new era in computer entertainment with this 256-color
VGA arcade-adventure game which is up to par with the top Sega Genesis and
Super Nintendo hits.  Features digital sound effects and a musical soundtrack
for the Sound Blaster and compatible cards!

     Guide the beautiful Jill through sixteen huge smooth-scrolling levels,
each filled with vivid new scenery and animated creatures.  Not only can Jill
run, jump, and use objects -- she can also magically transform into other
creatures such as birds, fish, and frogs.  In fact,  you will do quite a
bit of hopping, flying, and swimming to solve this game.

     Jill also supports CGA and EGA cards,  but the real thrill of this game
is the spectacular 256-color VGA artwork and animation.  In fact,  we believe
games like Duke Nukum could learn a few tricks from the smoothly-animated
Jill.

     þ  CGA, EGA, or VGA graphics (supports high-quality 256-color graphics.)
     þ  80286 or faster processor recommended

Note:  You can probably tell that we here at Epic MegaGames are very proud
       of this release.  After nine months in production and the extensive
       work of an artist,  musician,  and a professional Nintendo animator,
       we feel this game is really hot!
