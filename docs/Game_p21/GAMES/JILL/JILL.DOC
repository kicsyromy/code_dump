=============================================================================


Jill of the Jungle is a Nintendo-style arcade adventure game with 256-color
VGA graphics,  great sound effects,  and a Sound Blaster-compatible musical
sound track.  This immense game world,  Volume I in the Jill series,
challenges both your mind and your arcade reflexes -- fun for the whole
family!

   HINT

This game is equiped with a "Save" feature -- so remember to save your game
often.  Later on,  if your bratty little brother unplugs the computer
while you are playing,  you won't need to start over!

   HOW TO START:

To go,  just type JILL from the DOS prompt -- and you're ready to begin.
If you don't have a 100% IBM-compatible computer with at least 512K of RAM
and color graphics,  go buy one now!  Jill is a high-tech game which requires
a lot of computing power (An 80286 processor is recommended).

   NOTE TO SOUND BLASTER OWNERS:

Jill sports a musical sound track and digitized sound effects.  If you
experience trouble with Jill (lockups or aborts), try booting from a blank
floppy disk with no TSR's loaded.  If this doesn't solve the problem, your
best bet is to <gasp> TURN OFF THE DIGITAL SOUND EFFECTS and MUSIC.

Sorry, Jill doesn't support the Adlib card.  Only Sound Blaster & compatibles.

   NOTE TO OS/2 USERS

On some computers,  Jill only runs under OS/2 with ALL SOUND DISABLED.  So if
Jill isn't working properly under OS/2, run the game by typing:
   JILL /NOSND


   TROUBLE-SHOOTING

If Jill locks up when you first run the game, type:
   JILL /NOSB  (if you don't have a Sound Blaster)
   JILL /SB    (if you do have a Sound Blaster)
   JILL /NOSND (as a last resort, disables all sound)

If Jill is giving you intermittent problems, boot from a blank floppy disk
with no TSR's in memory.  You might possibly run into problems with:
   - Memory managers like QEMM
   - Disk Caches
   - Any other kind of TSR program

Make sure your FILES= and BUFFERS= lines in CONFIG.SYS are set to at least 25.
