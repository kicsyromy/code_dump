About Shareware...
------------------
Shareware (also known as user supported software and other names) is a 
concept not understood by everyone.  The authors of Shareware retain all
rights to the software under the copyright laws while still allowing
free distribution.  This gives the user the chance to freely obtain and
try out software to see if it fits his needs.  Shareware should not be
confused with Public Domain Software even though they are often obtained
from the same sources.
   
If you continue to use Shareware after trying it out, you are expected
to register with the author and pay a registration fee.  What you get in 
return depends on the author, but may include a printed manual, free 
updates, telephone support, etc.  Only by paying for the Shareware you 
use do you enable the Shareware author to continue to support his software 
and create new programs.  Considering that the Shareware registration fees 
are almost always far less than the purchase price of comparable commercial 
software it's obvious that Shareware is a good deal for everyone.
   
There are real advantages to you in the Shareware system.  You get to
try out software to make sure it is compatible with your hardware and
that it fits your needs before you "buy" it with your registration.
The author saves the expense of advertising, packaging and distribution
and passes the savings on to you.  Plus, most Shareware authors are
much more accessible than commercial software sources so that your
questions and suggestions are much more likely to be responded to.
