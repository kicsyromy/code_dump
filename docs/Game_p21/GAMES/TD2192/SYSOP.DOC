1. Create a file area on your BBS called "Safari Software" or just "Safari".

2. Call Exec-PC at 414-789-4360 and log on as a new user.

3. Download all the files in the Safari file area and post them on your BBS.

4. Keep calling every 1-3 weeks to check out and download the latest news
   and files.

Or get the entire Safari file collection by mail
