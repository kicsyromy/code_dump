        Configuring Traffic Department 2192
=============================================================================

The first time you run Traffic Department 2192, a self-explanatory
configuration menu will come up asking for the type of controller and
sound card you want to use. The information you give in this configuration
is stored and used every time you run T.D.

To reconfigure Traffic Department 2192, type "TD1 /config" at the "C:" prompt.

If you would like to temporarily change your configuration, type in
the command you want to use after typing "TD1".

For example, typing "TD1 /?"  gives you a list the available commands.
        
        /?       : displays this list.

        /sb      : plays music and sound effects through your Sound Blaster.        

        /nosound : turns off all music and sound effects.

        /pc      : plays sound effects through your PC speaker.

        /a       : gives you AdLib music with PC speaker sound effects.

        /config  : brings up the configuration menu.

        Common problems and solutions
=============================================================================


RUNNING WITH WINDOWS AND OS/2
=============================

This game should work properly under Windows and OS/2 if you turn all
sound card support OFF when configuring the game.  However, if you want 
to hear music or sound through your Sound Blaster, or compatible music 
card, you must run T.D. 2192 through DOS.

More Windows and OS/2 tips:

1. Even though T.D. 2192 will work under Windows with sound card support
   turned OFF,  the graphics will run more smoothly under plain DOS.

2. If you try to run T.D. 2192 through Windows or OS/2 with sound card
   support ON,  you'll get unpredictable results - T.D. 2192 will not
   run properly.

3. If you encounter any problems running through Windows or OS/2, exit and
   run T.D. 2192 through plain DOS instead!  This will likely solve any
   problems you are encountering.

4. Running T.D. 2192 through the "MS-DOS Shell" in Windows (or the
   OS/2 DOS box) is NOT the same as running it straight from DOS.  For
   best results, you need to completely exit from Windows or OS/2 and run
   T.D. 2192 from the DOS prompt.


NOT ENOUGH FREE MEMORY
======================

Problem:  When I run T.D. 2192, the game refuses to start and gives
   me the message "You need (amount) of free memory to run this program".

Solution:  You need to free up more main (conventional) memory before
   starting T.D. 2192.  Here are some solutions:

1. If you are trying to run T.D. 2192 from Windows, completely exit
   Windows and try running it from DOS.

2. If you are trying to run T.D. 2192 from "DOSSHELL" or any other
   menu program,  please exit from the menu program.  Then, run T.D. 2192
   from the DOS prompt.  Menu programs often occupy enough memory that
   there won't be enough left for T.D. 2192.

If neither #1 or #2 solves the problem,  do the following:

1. From the DOS prompt,  type "MEM" and press Enter.

2. You'll see a lot of information about your computer's memory.  Look at
   the number after the words "Largest Executable Program Size".  This is
   the amount of memory you currently have available.

Now you need to free up more main memory.  Here are some tips:


1. You may need to modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
   in your root directory.  This can be done in any version of DOS.

   Rewrite your CONFIG.SYS file to contain the lines:

           HIMEM.SYS
           EMM386.EXE NOEMS HIGHSCAN
           DOS=HIGH,UMB

2. We also recommend that you clean out all other TSR's and memory
   managers from CONFIG.SYS by either removing the line, or by typing
   "REM" before the command.
   
3. Once your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files have been changed, you must
   restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Do this by
   pressing the CTRL-ALT-DEL keys simultaneously.

4. A handy program for MS-DOS 6.0+ users is MEMMAKER.  This file will 
   help you optimize your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to allow 
   you optimal memory conservation.

5. Please read the manual that came with DOS for more information about
   configuring memory.

OTHER PROBLEMS
==============

Problem:
   When I run T.D. 2192, I don't hear sound.

Solution:
   Traffic Department will only play music if you have a Sound Blaster or
   100% compatible sound card. If you have a Sound Blaster or 100% compatible
   sound card, and you still can't hear music, try one of the following.

1. Make sure Traffic Department 2192 is configured to play sound by typing
   "TD1 /config" at the "C:" prompt.

2. Check your sound card and speaker connections.

3. Make sure your sound card has no address conflicts with other cards in 
   your system! If your sound card works properly with other games, you can 
   assume that there are no conflicts.  However, if your sound card does not 
   work with other games,  you have a conflict.  See your sound card manual 
   for details on resolving these conflicts.
