                       ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS


   QUESTION:  I get the message "VGA Monitor required." when I try  to
              run Redhook's Revenge.  What I do?

   ANSWER:    Your  IBM compatible PC doesn't have a VGA monitor.   If
              you  want to run Redhook's Revenge, you will have to  go
              to a computer store to see it run.  Maybe you'll  decide
              that it's time to get a new computer!


   QUESTION:  Can I run Redhook's Revenge from a floppy drive?

   ANSWER:    Yes, by entering the command REDHOOK, but the game  will
              run slower than it would on a hard drive.


   QUESTION:  How do I install Redhook's Revenge to my hard drive?

   ANSWER:    We  have provided a simple installation program so  that
              you can install Redhook's Revenge to your hard drive:
             1.  Insert the diskette into the floppy drive.
             2.  Type A:INSTALL (or B:INSTALL) then press [Enter].
             3.  Follow  the  instructions  as  they  appear  on  your
                 screen.  You can install it to any directory that you
                 want to, but for the purposes of this  documentation,
                 we assume that you will install it to C:\REDHOOK.


   QUESTION:  My mouse works in Microsoft Windows, why doesn't it work
              in Redhook's Revenge?

   ANSWER:    Windows  has special built-in drivers to support   mice.
              Our  software  looks for a Microsoft   compatible  mouse
              driver which is loaded when you  turn on your  computer.
              A  diskette  should  have  come with  your  mouse  which
              contains  MOUSE.SYS,   MOUSE.COM or similar  files.  Try
              placing   the    command  DEVICE = MOUSE.SYS   in   your
              CONFIG.SYS  file  or  the   command  MOUSE.COM  in  your
              AUTOEXEC.BAT  file.    These  are  the  files  that  DOS
              executes  when you  turn on your computer, and  if  your
              mouse  is  Microsoft compatible, your mouse  should  now
              work.




   QUESTION:  Can Redhook's Revenge be run under Microsoft Windows?

   ANSWER:    Yes, although it is not a Windows product.  Here's how:
           1.  In  the Program Manager press the ALT-F for the  "Files
               Menu".
           2.  Press N for "New".
           3.  Select "Program Item".
           4.  Under "Description" enter Redhook.
           5.  Under "Command Line" enter \REDHOOK\REDHOOK.PIF.
           6.  Press the "Change Icon" button and when it prompts  for
               the file name enter \REDHOOK\REDHOOK.ICO then press OK.


   QUESTION:  I  get the message "Not enough memory" and  my   program
              doesn't run. What can I do?

   ANSWER:    You  need a computer with at least 640K memory  to   run
              our software. Run the CHKDSK command to make  sure  that
              you  have "655360 total bytes memory".   The  last  line
              tells  you how many bytes your  computer has  free.   If
              your  computer  has  less than   560000  bytes  free,  a
              program loaded in your  CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT  file
              is taking up  memory. Locate a knowledgeable person  and
              ask  him/her to help you get these programs out of  your
              memory.  If  you  have  a 286  or  386  computer  and  1
              megabyte  of  memory or more, you  can  free  additional
              memory by upgrading to DOS 5.0.


   QUESTION:  I  don't understand what "shareware" is.  Why do I  have
              to  order Redhook's Revenge if I already have a copy  of
              it?

   ANSWER:    Because  you  haven't  paid for  it.   If  you  "bought"
              Redhook's Revenge from a shareware vendor, you only paid
              for  the disk, not the actual program.  At  the  opening
              screen  of  Redhook's  Revenge, press  the  F2  key.   A
              detailed  explanation about the shareware  concept  will
              appear for you there.

              To reward those who actually register Redhook's  Revenge
              we have included extra "bonus" features which are not in
              the shareware version.  See the order form for details.
